# Python-Cybersecurity-Lab-Simulator

Interactive, console-based lab that demonstrates a Trojan horse attack and the corresponding defense workflow. Run the simulated malware, watch its behavior in real time, then neutralize it with the companion antivirus tool. **For educational use only; do not run on production machines.**

## Components
- [trojan_calculator.py](trojan_calculator.py): Trojan payload disguised as a calculator; steals sample files and tags one as "infected".
- [trojan_monitor.py](trojan_monitor.py): Real-time attack visualization and post-attack summary dashboard.
- [trojan_antivirus.py](trojan_antivirus.py): Scans for the educational Trojan signatures, quarantines artifacts, and writes scan reports.
- [demo_lab.sh](demo_lab.sh): Guided demo script for Linux/Kali terminals.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed and on PATH.
- Run in a disposable lab environment (Windows Terminal/PowerShell or Linux shell). Do **not** use on real/production data.

## Quickstart (Windows or Linux)
```bash
# Clone your repo, then
cd path/to/Python-Cybersecurity-Lab-Simulator
```

1) **Open two terminals** in this directory.
- Terminal A: Monitor the attack.
- Terminal B: Run the Trojan, then the antivirus.

2) **Start the real-time monitor (Terminal A):**
```bash
python3 trojan_monitor.py
# choose option 2: Real-time Trojan Activity Monitor
```

3) **Run the Trojan calculator (Terminal B):**
```bash
python3 trojan_calculator.py
```
- Use the calculator UI to trigger background theft/infection activity.

4) **Scan and clean with the antivirus (Terminal B):**
```bash
python3 trojan_antivirus.py
# pick option 2 to run full scan + quarantine
```

## What to Look At
- Stolen artifacts: [stolen_data/](stolen_data/) (copied files, theft logs, infection logs).
- Infected sample files: [test_files/](test_files/) (e.g., document1.txt gets a Trojan marker appended).
- Scan outputs: [scan_reports/](scan_reports/) JSON reports generated by the antivirus.
- Quarantine results: [quarantine/](quarantine/) holds moved/deactivated artifacts.

## Demo Script (Linux/Kali)
If you prefer the guided flow, run:
```bash
bash demo_lab.sh
```
Follow the prompts: it walks you through running the Trojan, monitor, and antivirus in the right order.

## Safety Notice
- Educational simulation only; behaves like malware (file copying/modification) inside the repo directory.
- Use isolated lab folders or throwaway VMs/containers. Do not point it at real data.
